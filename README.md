# Cookiecutter Data Science

_A logical, reasonably standardized but flexible project structure for doing and sharing data science work._

**Cookiecutter Data Science (CCDS)** is a tool for setting up a data science project template that incorporates best practices. To learn more about CCDS's philosophy, visit the [project homepage](https://cookiecutter-data-science.drivendata.org/).

> ℹ️ Cookiecutter Data Science v2 has changed from v1. It now requires installing the new cookiecutter-data-science Python package, which extends the functionality of the [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/README.html) templating utility. Use the provided `ccds` command-line program instead of `cookiecutter`.

## Installation

Cookiecutter Data Science v2 requires Python 3.8+. Since this is a cross-project utility application, we recommend installing it with [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/). Installation command options:

```bash
# With pipx from PyPI (recommended)
pipx install cookiecutter-data-science

# With pip from PyPI
pip install cookiecutter-data-science

# With conda from conda-forge (coming soon)
# conda install cookiecutter-data-science -c conda-forge
```

## Starting a new project

1. Create OneNote notebook from template
2. Create MS Planner board
3. Initialize code project from ccds template (Miniconda, cookiecutter)
4. Init Git repo (git init)
5. Connect git remote
6. Enjoy!




### OneNote
    1. Open C:\Users\ValgaevO\OneDrive - AIT\Documents\OneNote Notebooks
    2. Double click on "template_notebook"
    3. Create new OneNote notebook from a template

### Microsoft Planner
    1. Create new ToDo plan
    
### Code
    1. Open MINICONDA
    2. Run: cd C:\Users\ValgaevO\Lokal documents\01_code\01_ait-projects
    3. Initiate project with cookiecutter template from conda
        a. Run: conda activate base
            i. Check if cookiecutter package is installed: conda list
            ii. If not installed: conda install cookiecutter 
            iii. Alternative: conda install ccds
        b. Init from a cookiecutter template from my github: ccds https://github.com/q909/template_project
    4. Init GIT repo: VScode or git init
    5. Create a remote repo online (GitHub or GitLab)
    6. Add GIT remote: git remote add origin https://github.com/q909/my_test_repo
    7. Publish branch and sync with remote





To start a new project, cd to your folder and run in miniconda:

```bash
ccds https://github.com/q909/template_project
```





### The resulting directory structure

The directory structure of your new project will look something like this (depending on the settings that you choose):

```

## Using v1

If you want to use the old v1 project template, you need to have either the cookiecutter-data-science package or cookiecutter package installed. Then, use either command-line program with the `-c v1` option:

```bash
ccds https://github.com/drivendataorg/cookiecutter-data-science -c v1
# or equivalently
cookiecutter https://github.com/drivendataorg/cookiecutter-data-science -c v1
```
